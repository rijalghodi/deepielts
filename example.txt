## Detailed Feedback

### Improve Each Paragraphs

#### INTRODUCTION
_"Learning practical skills such as growing food and cooking can benefit students in many ways. Firstly, these skills promote independence and healthier lifestyles. For example, students who understand nutrition and food preparation may avoid fast food and eat more balanced meals. Furthermore, gardening classes can raise awareness of environmental issues, such as sustainability and food waste."_

##### Comments

- **Task Response/Task Achievement:** Your introduction presents a clear argument in favour of teaching practical skills, but it could be strengthened by explicitly reflecting the contrasting view as well. Including the opposing perspective would provide more depth to your response right from the start. For example, referencing that some believe these skills are unnecessary would give a rounder introduction.
- **Coherence & Cohesion:** Ensure that your ideas flow logically. While you present benefits well, consider introducing a clearer transitional phrase that indicates the shift from the benefits to the opposing view. This helps the reader anticipate the contrasting discussion.
- **Grammatical Range & Accuracy:** The use of “Firstly” suggests a list; however, consider using varied transitional phrases such as “To begin with” or “In addition” to improve diversity in your sentence structure. Also, you might consider rephrasing "students who understand nutrition and food preparation may avoid fast food" to engage a more active voice.
- **Lexical Resource:** While the vocabulary is appropriate, enhancing it with synonyms or more precise terms could amplify your argument. For instance, instead of saying “healthier lifestyles,” consider “more nutritious dietary habits” for specificity.

##### Revised Version
_"The acquisition of practical skills such as growing food and cooking can yield significant benefits for students. To begin with, these skills foster independence and encourage more nutritious dietary habits. For instance, students who grasp the principles of nutrition and food preparation are likely to avoid fast food and consume more balanced meals. Additionally, gardening classes can cultivate awareness of environmental issues such as sustainability and food waste."_

<hr></hr>

#### BODY PARAGRAPH 1
_"On the other hand, opponents argue that school time should focus on academic subjects like mathematics and science, which are more important for future careers. They believe that cooking and gardening are responsibilities parents should teach at home, not teachers at school."_

##### Comments

- **Task Response/Task Achievement:** This paragraph effectively presents the counterargument, which is essential for a balanced discussion. However, you might want to elaborate on why opponents believe academic subjects are more critical and provide specific examples or data supporting their views to enhance the depth of your ideas.
- **Coherence & Cohesion:** The use of “On the other hand” properly signals a contrast. To improve clarity and coherence, interlink the sentences with phrases like “support their claims” when explaining what opponents argue about parental responsibility.
- **Grammatical Range & Accuracy:** The sentence structures are simple but could benefit from more complex forms. For instance, you could use relative clauses to provide additional context: “...which they argue are more important...” instead of “which are more important”.
- **Lexical Resource:** The phrase “future careers” is commonly used; consider a less predictable phrase such as “professional development” to enhance your lexical variety.

##### Revised Version
_"Conversely, critics assert that academic subjects such as mathematics and science should take precedence during school hours, as they are deemed more vital for professional development. Moreover, they contend that the onus of teaching cooking and gardening lies with parents at home, rather than educators in schools."_

<hr></hr>

#### BODY PARAGRAPH 2
_"In my opinion, schools should include these skills as optional courses. While academic knowledge is crucial, practical life skills help young people become well-rounded and responsible adults. Therefore, a balance between academic and practical subjects is the best solution."_

##### Comments

- **Task Response/Task Achievement:** You clearly state your opinion, making your position explicit, which is a strength. However, consider bolstering your argument with specific advantages of practical skills that go beyond merely being "well-rounded." For instance, you could reference how these skills prepare students for real-world challenges.
- **Coherence & Cohesion:** The link between the need for practical skills and the proposition of them being optional could be stronger. Adding a transitional phrase like “For instance” could improve the flow by connecting your ideas better.
- **Grammatical Range & Accuracy:** The phrase "should include these skills" might be strengthened by varying the modality. You might say "ought to incorporate these skills" for a more sophisticated expression.
- **Lexical Resource:** Phrases like "balance between academic and practical subjects" can be made more vivid. Instead of "practical subjects," specific examples like “life skills education” may add clarity.

##### Revised Version
_"In my view, schools ought to incorporate practical skills such as growing food and cooking as optional courses. While academic knowledge remains essential, such life skills equip young people to tackle real-world challenges and emerge as responsible adults. Hence, a well-rounded education that balances both academic subjects and practical skills would be the most advantageous approach."_

## Model Essay

### Revised Essay

Learning practical skills such as growing food and cooking can greatly benefit students in many ways. Firstly, these skills promote independence and foster healthier lifestyles. For example, students who understand nutrition and food preparation are more likely to avoid fast food and consume balanced meals. Furthermore, gardening classes can enhance awareness of environmental issues such as sustainability and food waste. 

On the other hand, opponents argue that school time should be dedicated to academic subjects like mathematics and science, which they deem more essential for future careers. They believe that cooking and gardening are responsibilities that should fall to parents, rather than educators. 

In my opinion, schools should offer these skills as optional courses. While academic knowledge is undeniably essential, practical life skills help young people to become well-rounded and responsible adults. Therefore, a balance between academic and practical subjects is the best solution.

### Band 8.0 - 9.0 Sample Essay

The debate on whether students should learn to grow food and cook at school has gained prominence in recent years. Proponents emphasize the myriad advantages of these practical skills, including enhanced self-sufficiency and the promotion of healthier dietary habits. Students who grasp concepts of nutrition and culinary skills are less inclined to rely on fast food, opting instead for wholesome, home-cooked meals. Moreover, engaging with gardening allows learners to appreciate environmental concerns, including issues like sustainability and reducing food waste.

Conversely, dissenters contend that the academic curriculum should take precedence, focusing on subjects such as mathematics and science, which are crucial for future employment opportunities. They argue that cooking and gardening are life skills that families should teach at home, limiting the school's role in this regard. 

In my opinion, integrating these practical skills into the school curriculum as elective courses would be beneficial. While a solid foundation in academic subjects is vital for career success, equipping students with essential life skills ensures they develop into well-rounded individuals. Thus, striking a balance between academic rigor and practical training presents the most effective approach for preparing students for adulthood.
