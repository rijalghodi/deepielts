## Detailed Feedback

### Improve Each Paragraphs

#### SALUTATION

_"Hello."_

##### Comments

- **Task Response/Task Achievement:** While the salutation serves its purpose, it lacks depth and relevance to the task prompt. For a more engaging and context-rich salutation, consider addressing the recipient by their name or including a polite inquiry regarding their well-being, which could create a more personal connection.
- **Coherence & Cohesion:** The salutation, while appropriate, is too vague. Adding context would help enhance the flow into the subsequent paragraphs. Consider transitioning smoothly into the main content of your response by using a greeting that reflects the topic of discussion.
- **Grammatical Range & Accuracy:** There are no grammatical issues present in the salutation; however, adding formal elements could elevate it. You might want to include an exclamation mark for added enthusiasm, e.g., “Hello!”
- **Lexical Resource:** The term "Hello" is sufficient but quite basic. Using alternatives like "Greetings" or "Dear" could demonstrate a broader vocabulary range. 

##### Revised Version

_"Greetings!"_

<hr></hr>

// Continue with the next paragraph, and to the last paragraph, using the same format & structure.

### Improve Structure & Argument

#### TASK TYPE

- Formal Letter: Requesting Information or Action

#### KEY TIPS

- Start with a friendly salutation to establish rapport.
- Clearly outline your request early in the letter to ensure it captures attention.
- Conclude politely, reiterating your main points for clarity.

#### RECOMMENDED ESSAY OUTLINE/STRUCTURE

- **Introduction:** Introduce yourself and state the purpose of your letter, e.g. "I am writing to inquire about..."
- **Body Paragraph 1:** Detail your first request or question, providing any necessary information.
- **Body Paragraph 2:** Include additional requests or questions, ensuring clear separation between different points.
- **Conclusion:** Politely summarise your requests and express gratitude, e.g. "Thank you for your assistance."

Effective communication is a cornerstone of human interaction. The simple act of saying "hello" not only initiates a conversation but also sets the tone for the ensuing dialogue. It is a universally recognized greeting that transcends cultural differences, demonstrating our shared humanity. The warm exchange of "hello" fosters connections, making individuals feel acknowledged and valued.
